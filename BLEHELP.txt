Step 5 and Beyond: Using the Bluefruit Connect App
🔵 STEP 5: Connect to Your Board
On your mobile device, install [Adafruit Bluefruit Connect]:

📱 iOS: App Store

📱 Android: Google Play

Power up your Circuit Playground Bluefruit

Open the app → Tap “Connect” → Choose GForceGauge

📈 STEP 6: View Streaming Data
You can now use the following tabs:

🧭 UART Tab
Tap UART → See live data: G: 1.32, G: 2.45, etc.

This is raw serial output from bleuart.println()

📊 Plotter Tab
Tap Plotter

Live graph of your G-force data

Great for seeing spikes, crashes, and cornering force in real time

🧪 STEP 7: Testing It
Move, shake, or drop the board gently.

Look for:

Live values on UART tab

Real-time graphs on Plotter tab

NeoPixels turning red when force increases

🎒 STEP 8: Optional Enhancements
Add battery service: Bluefruit.Battery.begin();

Send more data: Add direction (x, y, z)

Control modes from phone (e.g., toggle NeoPixels via UART)

OTA Settings: Use Bluefruit app sliders/buttons to send config thresholds

Would you like me to show how to make the app control the board (like changing thresholds or clearing peak force) via BLE commands?
